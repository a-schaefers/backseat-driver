#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The repository's GitHub settings, kept in git (2026-10-10). Settings clicked
# by hand drift; these are applied from here and checked from here.
#
#   scripts/github-settings.sh check    say what differs from this file (read only)
#   scripts/github-settings.sh apply    make GitHub match it
#
# Needs `gh` logged in as the repository's admin. REPO overrides the target.
#
# What it holds:
#   - main's ruleset (.github/rulesets/main.json): no direct push, no force push,
#     no deletion; a pull request with `check` green (from GitHub Actions only)
#     and one approval, stale approvals dismissed. No bypass actor: the owner
#     and every agent get the same rule. owner-merge.yml approves the owner's
#     pull requests; anyone else's waits for the owner.
#   - Actions may approve pull requests (owner-merge.yml's approval), and the
#     default token is read only (each workflow asks for what it needs).
#   - Auto-merge allowed, merge commits allowed, a branch deleted when merged,
#     an out-of-date branch can be updated from the pull request.
#   - Only GitHub-owned and verified actions run, each pinned to a commit.
#   - A fork's workflows wait for approval every time, not only the first.
#   - Secret scanning with push protection; Dependabot alerts and fixes.
#
# The emergency door: when the check itself is broken and its fix cannot pass
# it, the owner sets the ruleset's enforcement to disabled (Settings → Rules,
# or edit the JSON's "enforcement" and apply), merges the fix, and sets it back
# (`check` here shows the drift if that is forgotten). Never a bypass actor.
