# The one road to main (2026-10-10). main takes no direct push (the ruleset in
# .github/rulesets/main.json): every change is a pull request whose `check`
# passes. This pushes the checkout's commits to a branch, opens its pull
# request (or finds the open one), arms auto-merge as you, and waits for the
# merge or for the check that failed. owner-merge.yml approves the owner's
# pull request; anyone else's waits for the owner's review.
#
#   scripts/ship.sh                    the current branch; a detached HEAD (a
#                                      worktree) ships as agent/<worktree>
#   scripts/ship.sh --title "…"        default: the newest commit's subject
#   scripts/ship.sh --body-file FILE   default: every commit message on the branch
#   scripts/ship.sh --squash           a squash merge instead of a merge commit
#   scripts/ship.sh --no-wait          arm auto-merge and return
#   scripts/ship.sh --draft            open it as a draft: nothing merges it
#
# A red check leaves auto-merge armed: fix, commit, run this again (the same
# branch, the same pull request).
#
# IT ARMS ONLY ITS OWN PULL REQUEST, AT ITS OWN COMMIT. A fork can open a pull
# request from a branch of any name, and this runs with your write access: found
# by branch name alone, a stranger's pull request could be armed to merge
# itself. So the pull request must come from this repository, and every merge
# it asks for names the exact commit it pushed (--match-head-commit).
